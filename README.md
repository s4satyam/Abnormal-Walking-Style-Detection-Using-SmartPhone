# Abnormal-Walking-Style-Detection-Using-SmartPhone
This is Mine Master Thesis Report for 1 year research in IOT and ML.
This research is to classify how a person walks and if he walks abnormaly how much abnormality is their(Mild,Severe,Moderate).
The Report File contains:

# Data Collection
# Algorithm to extract gait parameters
# EDA on data extracted
# Classification[RF,Decison Tree,Naive Bayes]
# Challenge and Improvement.

I used MATLAB for extracting Gait Parameters and R for classification.
Then Used Decsion Tree Model For REAL TIME WALKING STYLE DETECTION.
# Note: The Code and data not provided as a part of IEEE policy. 



The Paper Has Been Published in IEEE XPLORE in JAN 2018.
